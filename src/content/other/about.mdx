konnichiwa! I’m Zach, a purple teamer, CTF enthusiast, and a CTF challenge creator! I’m fascinated by all things IT, and I live by the motto: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” My passion includes building labs that are full of vulnerabilities and CVEs, and I love to test their limits by simulating attacks on it. After that I like to take a look at what artefacts are left behind through digital forensics.
